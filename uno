Uno card game
//rules
The first player is normally the player to the left of the dealer and gameplay usually follows a clockwise direction.

Every player views his/her cards and tries to match the card in the Discard Pile.

You have to match either by the number, color, or the symbol/Action.

    If:
		  The player has no matches or they choose not to play any of their cards even though they might have a match
	
   	Then:
	 	  they must draw a card from the Draw pile.

There are two different ways to play regarding drawing new cards. 

   	If:
 		  a card that matches is drawn 

   	then:
		  the player can discard it if it is a match,


   	If: 
		  a card that doesn't match is drawn

   	Then:
		  the play passes on to the next player.


 
   The other type is where players continue to draw cards until they have a match.


The game continues until a player has one card left. 


The moment a player has just one card they must yell “UNO!”. 


 	  If:
		  they are caught not saying “Uno” by another player before any card has been played
	
   	then:
		  the player must draw two new cards. 



Once a player has no cards remaining, the game round is over, points are scored, and the game begins over again.
